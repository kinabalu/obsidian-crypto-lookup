# FYI The API backing the plugin is gone so looking for a viable alternative

Lookup of crypto -> a target currency value using the [Cryptonator API](https://www.cryptonator.com/api).

### Features

- Better error handling / checking 

### Installation
The Crypto Lookup for Obsidian plugin release is pending review.

### Manual Installation
Two methods and the first one is easier:

#### Method 1
- Enable community plugins and install Obsidian42 - BRAT
- Go to settings and under Beta Plugin List click "Add Beta plugin" and type kinabalu/obsidian-crypto-lookup

#### Method 2
- Create an `obsidian-oura-plugin` folder under `.obsidian/plugins` in your vault. Add the
  `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and the `styles.css` files from the
  [latest release](https://github.com/kinabalu/obsidian-crypto-lookup/releases) to the folder.
